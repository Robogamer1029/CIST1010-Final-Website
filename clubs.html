                    The purpose of the UNO Maker Group is to support and grow STEM and MAKER activities at UNO and throughout the surrounding community. We do this by creating a supportive community of makers that can share knowledge and resources with each other. The club will have regularly scheduled sessions where members can bring their own projects to work on and collaborate with other makers in the community by sharing knowledge and equipment.

                    From Maker Group, I learned of opprotunities to create things. I learned of an outlet to get help making things if I need. I also got a handful of friends from there.

                <p>
                    MavLabs is a community that empowers students to collaborate on creative projects to explore their interests and even develop new ones. Any student, no matter their skill level, is allowed to join an existing project or start a new project. If you don't want to join or start a project then that's fine as well, you can join us at our different club events to socialize and network with other students.
